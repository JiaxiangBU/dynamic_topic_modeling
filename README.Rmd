# wei_lda_debate

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of 'wei_lda_debate' is to build Latent Dirichlet Allocation models based on 'sklearn' and 'gensim' framework, and Dynamic Topic Model based on 'gensim' framework.
I decide to build a Python package, so this reposority will be updated.
The new reposority path is <https://github.com/JiaxiangBU/dynamic_topic_modeling.git>.
